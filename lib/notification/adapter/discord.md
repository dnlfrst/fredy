### Discord Adapter

To use Discord, you need to create a bot and add it to your server. You'll need the bot token and the channel ID where you want Fredy to send notifications.

1. Create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Add the bot to your server.
3. Copy the bot token and the channel ID where you want to receive notifications.

Add these details to your configuration file.
